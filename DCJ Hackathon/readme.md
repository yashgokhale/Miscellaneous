# "EDA and Business Intelligence to derive analytics from user subscription data" 
## Data Career Jumpstart Hackathon - Oct/Nov 2021
#### Team: Kedeisha Bryan, Yash Gokhale, Michelle T. , Stephanie

This project and the subsequent codes were developed as a submission to Data Career Jumpstart Hackathon 2021. The aim of the project was to conduct exploratory data analysis for user subscription data for a newsletter, "Column" and derive insights into the best time to send the newsletter to maximize subsciber rate and to analyze which topic is the most viewed, conducted using NLP (Natural Language Processing) bag of words model.

The date and time of sending the newsletter was visualized and it can be observed that maximum open rate (which is the metric to be used) is the highest when the newsletter is sent out between 6 to 8 am in the morning, which gives an idea of how the readers are most active. However, no clear model could be fit into this as the data is somewhat scattered and thus, it is important to look at other variables which could affect the open rate.
